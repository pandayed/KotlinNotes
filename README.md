# Kotlin Notes
This repository contains the **precise code**, I saved while learning Kotlin so that in future I can revise easily.  
  
The code has **necessary comments** for understanding the topic.
  
Although a lot of concepts have already been added, but if you wish to add more, feel free to fork, make changes and send pull requests.

I will be making the repo better with suggestions and adding more while learning more.  
  
Suggestions welcome at lalbiharipandeyg@gmail.com

If you are using the repo or have thoughts about using the repo in the future, **you can consider giving it a star**.
