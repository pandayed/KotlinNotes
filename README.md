# Kotlin Notes
This repository contains the **precise code** I saved while learning Kotlin so that in future I can revise easily.  
  
The code has **necessary comments** for understanding the topic.
  
Enough explanation comments have been added so that anyone having clear thoughts about programming fundamentals like variables, functions etc in any language like C++ or Java can learn Kotlin by reading the comments and executing the code.  
  
If you wish to learn Kotlin and have done some code in another language, you can **consider this repository as a primary learing resource**. 
  
Although the fundamentals and a lot of concepts have already been added, but if you wish to add more, please feel free to fork, make changes and send pull requests.
I will definately merge to make the repo better.

I will be making the repo better with suggestions and adding more while learning more.  
  
Suggestions welcome at lalbiharipandeyg@gmail.com

If you are using the repo or have thoughts about using the repo in the future, **you can consider giving it a star**.
