# Kotlin Notes
This repository contains the **precise code** I saved while learning Kotlin so that in future I can revise easily.  
  
The code has **necessary comments** for understanding the topic.
  
Enough explanation comments have been added so that anyone having clear thoughts about programming fundamentals like variables, functions etc in any language like C++ and Java can learn Kotlin by reading the comments and running the code.  
  
If you wish to learn Kotlin and have done some code in another language, you can **consider this repository as a primary learing resource**. 
  
I will be making the repo better with suggestions and adding more while learning more.  
  
Suggestions welcome at lalbiharipandeyg@gmail.com

If you are using the repo or have thoughts about using the repo in the future, **you can consider giving it a star**.
